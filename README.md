# Data-visualization-using-Matplotlib-and-Seaborn
This is my work sample of data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib plotting libraries in Python. 
The dataset used is the Haberman dataset, which is a dataset containing data about the Breast cancer survivors between 1958 and 1969. 
The jupyter notebook is heavily documented with everything you would need to understand this dataset along with all the conclusions made.
Have fun!
